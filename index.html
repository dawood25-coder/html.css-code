    <h2><b>Residents of Nepal’s flood-hit capital returned to their mud-caked homes on Sunday to survey the wreckage of
            devastating floods that have killed at least 148 people across the Himalayan republic.</b></h2>
<h3><article>Deadly rain-related floods and landslides are common across South Asia during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.</article></h3>
<h3>Entire neighbourhoods in Kathmandu were inundated over the weekend with flash floods reported in rivers coursing through the capital and extensive damage to highways connecting the city with the rest of Nepal.
</h3>
<h3>Kumar Tamang, who lives in a slum area by a riverbank, told AFP that he and his family had to flee after midnight on Saturday as waters rushed into his shack.</h3>
<h3>“This morning we returned and everything looks different,” the 40-year-old said. “We couldn’t even open the doors to our house, it was jammed with mud,” he added. “Yesterday we were afraid that the water would kill us, but today we have no water to clean.”</h3>
